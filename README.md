Capsule is a web-based Docker management tool designed with simplicity and user-friendliness at its core. Say goodbye to complex YAML and cryptic commands. Capsule provides an intuitive "App Store" like experience to deploy and manage popular self-hosted applications like Jellyfin, the *arr stack (Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Bazarr), and more, all through guided wizards and a clean interface.

## ü§î Why Capsule?

While tools like Portainer are powerful, they can still be overwhelming for beginners. Capsule aims to bridge that gap by:

1.  **Abstracting Complexity:** We handle the Docker Compose generation behind the scenes.
2.  **Curated Experience:** Focusing on popular self-hosted apps with pre-configured, optimized templates.
3.  **Guided Setup:** Wizards make sure you don't miss crucial configuration steps.
4.  **Integrated Experience:** Access and manage key aspects of your apps (like your Jellyfin library) without leaving Capsule.

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      capsule:
        image: manuviswanadha/capsule:latest # Your Docker Hub username and image
        container_name: capsule
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "10000:10000" # Or your preferred host port
        volumes:
          - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Mount Docker socket
          - capsule_data:/app/data # Persistent storage for Capsule's configuration
        # Optional: Set Timezone
        # environment:
        #   - TZ=America/New_York
    
    volumes:
      capsule_data:
    ```

2.  **Save the file** and run the following command in the same directory:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Access Capsule:** Open your web browser and go to `http://<your-server-ip>:10000` (or `http://localhost:10000` if running locally).
